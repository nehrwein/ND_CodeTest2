# Task

Create an application that uses the Rebrickable LEGO API. The application should consist of two views.

1. On the overview page, users should be able to select Lego Themes in a dropdown. Lego Themes can be fetched from the themes API. When the user selects a theme the application should show all LEGO sets using this theme (from the sets API).

2. Users should be able to click on a set and go to a details view. The details view should display information about the LEGO set and also show a picture of the set. Users should be able to “like” a set in the details view. When a set is "liked" it should be visualized somehow in the overview page (e.g. with an icon, emoji or something).

This does not need to be stored in a database or anything, local state or session state is enough for this task.
