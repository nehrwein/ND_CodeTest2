# Project

I created an application that uses the Rebrickable LEGO API. The application consist of three views.

1. On the overview page, users are able to select Lego Themes in a dropdown. Lego Themes can be fetched from the themes API. When the user selects a theme the application jumps to the sets page

2. On the sets page all LEGO sets using the chosen theme (from the sets API) get displayed. Users are able to click on a set and go to a details view.

3. The details view displays information about the LEGO set and also shows a picture of the set. Users are able to “like” a set in the details view. When a set is "liked" it is visualized by a heart with arrow-emoji on the sets page.
